# Llama-Chatbot-with-Sentiment-Analysis-Integration ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Llama 2 Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis project. This chatbot doesnâ€™t just respond to your questions â€” it understands you. It taps into sentiment analysis to read between the lines and adjust its tone based on how youâ€™re feeling. Whether youâ€™re calm, curious, or a bit frustrated, this botâ€™s got you covered with dynamic responses.

**Why I Built This**

The challenge was to go beyond basic chatbot functionality. I wanted to build a more intuitive and responsive AI assistant, capable of adjusting its tone based on the userâ€™s sentiment. And guess what? Itâ€™s powered by Llama 2 from Hugging Face, and comes with a Gradio interface to make interacting with it super smooth.

**Features ðŸŒŸ**

Sentiment-Aware Responses: The chatbot adapts its replies based on your emotions, making interactions feel more natural and human-like.
QA Dataset Integration: It checks an existing dataset for known questions and answers before generating a response.

Llama 2 Model: If the answer isnâ€™t in the dataset, it turns to the Llama 2 model for a fresh response.
Customizable Responses: Future-proofed with custom prompt engineering and dynamic response generation based on context and mood.

**How It Works ðŸ’¡**

**Sentiment Analysis:** Iâ€™ve integrated a sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face. This allows the chatbot to gauge how you're feeling and adjust its responses. Feeling frustrated? It might take a more supportive tone. Calm? The response stays neutral.

**LLM for Question-Answering:** The chatbot first checks a pre-loaded dataset for known answers. If the answer isnâ€™t there, it uses the Llama 2 model to generate one on the fly.

**Dynamic Gradio UI:** The Gradio interface is clean and simple, making it easy to interact with the chatbot. Ask away!

**Setup ðŸ”§**

Ready to test it out? Here's how you can get started:

- **Clone the repo:** git clone <https://github.com/Tommy-Praise/Llama-Chatbot-with-Sentiment-Analysis-Integration>

- **Install the dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt

Next Steps

This is just the beginning! The future roadmap includes:

- Fine-tuning the AI for an even more specialized assistant role.

- Expanding the chatbotâ€™s context memory so it can handle longer, multi-turn conversations.

- Improving response accuracy and sentiment detection.

- Tweaking the Gradio UI to make it more interactive.
